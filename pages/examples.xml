      DerpTrolling are a recent hacker group that mainly use Twitter to announce their DDOS attacks, seemingly for “internet fame”. They claim to have been operating since 2011 but rose to prominence when they targeted the popular online game League of Legends and publicised live using a Skype call to a popular streamer. They then proceeded to take down the gaming servers of Dota2 and Club Penguin when “PhantomL0rd” switched to playing to them.
