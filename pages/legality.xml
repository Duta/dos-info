      Denial of Service attacks were made illegal in the UK in the Police and Justice Act of 2006; they are punishable with a maximum of 10 years in prison. Paying another person to launch an attack is also punishable by the same penalty. However, supplying someone with the tools to launch an attack, for example by offering access to a botnet, is punishable by a maximum of two years imprisonment.

      The Computer Misuse Act originally contained no information about DOS attacks, but after a teenager, David Lennon, sent five million emails to a former employer but received no punishment as the judge ruled that he had not committed an offence, it was obvious that something needed to be done.

      In the US, the attacks may be considered a crime under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; penalties include imprisonment. However, activist group Anonymous posted a “We the people” petition asking that DDOS attacks are considered as a legal form of protest, like the Occupy protests.
